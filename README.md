# DroidKaigi 2023: Introduction to Bytecode Instrumentation with AGP 8

Sample repository for the talk given at [DroidKaigi 2023](https://2023.droidkaigi.jp/) in Tokyo, Japan.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an exemplary implementation of the new Transform API introduced in Android Gradle Plugin 8.
Using the custom `@Redacted` annotation, developers can mark specific parameters of Kotlin `data classes`
as "sensitive". The bytecode transformer will remove the values of these annotation parameters from the string representation
of that particular class.

The project is divided into three Gradle modules:

- `api` defines two custom marker annotations
- `app` is a basic Jetpack Compose application to showcase the effects of the Transformer at runtime
- `transformer` provides the implementation of the custom Transformer
